# TODO List

Quick capture for ideas and tasks while coding. 
## Guidelines
- Use checkboxes `- [ ]` for actionable items
- Use bullet points `-` for ideas and thoughts
- Add date in parentheses (YYYY-MM-DD) when the task is done
- Keep it simple and informal - this is your working todo list

## Immediate Tasks
- [X] Listen for branch changes in real-time , save immediately when branch changes , start new session with new branch
- [X] Add branch name to time entries
- [ ] Update UI to show current branch in status bar
- [ ] Branch dropdown in summary view
- [ ] Add branch filter in time tracking summary
- [ ] Handle missing branch data in older time entries
- [ ] Fix race condition in branch detection during quick switches
- [ ] Add proper handling for detached HEAD state
- [ ] Implement data migration strategy for existing entries
- [ ] log each events in console.log

## Ideas
- Maybe add a quick pause button in status bar?
- A variable maybe for tracking the active coding session duration, and it will notify when it exceeds a certain threshold.
