## Time Tracking Details
The extension tracks your coding time by monitoring file changes and user activity within Visual Studio Code. It uses a combination of timers and event listeners to ensure accurate tracking without impacting performance.

**📖 For detailed configuration, advanced features, and complete documentation, see the [Time Tracking Guide](https://github.com/twentyTwo/vsc-ext-coding-time-tracker/wiki/Time-Tracking) in our wiki.**

## Health Notification System Details

The extension includes a comprehensive health notification system to promote healthy coding habits and prevent strain-related issues.

### 🔔 Smart Health Notifications
- **Eye Rest Reminders**: Every 20 minutes, get reminded to follow the 20-20-20 rule (look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds)
- **Stretch Reminders**: Every 30 minutes, get reminded to stand up and stretch your back and neck - Recommended for posture health
- **Break Suggestions**: Every 90 minutes, get prompted to take a proper break with multiple options - Based on ultradian rhythms
These are default values and designed to help you maintain focus and prevent fatigue during long coding sessions. You can always customize these intervals in the settings.

**📖 For detailed configuration, advanced features, and complete documentation, see the [Health Notifications Guide](https://github.com/twentyTwo/vsc-ext-coding-time-tracker/wiki/Health-Notifications) in our wiki.**

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for "Simple Coding Time Tracker"
4. Click "Install"

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically start tracking your coding time. You can view your current session time in the status bar at the bottom of the VSCode window.

### Using Search & Filters

1. In the summary view, locate the search form
2. Select a date range using the date pickers
3. Filter by project and/or branch:
   - Choose a specific project to see all its branches
   - Select a branch to see time data for that specific branch
   - The branch dropdown automatically updates to show only branches from the selected project
4. Click "Search" to apply filters
5. Use "Reset" to clear all filters and refresh the view

The charts and visualizations will automatically update to reflect your selected project and branch filters.

### Configuration Options

You can customize the extension's behavior through VS Code settings:

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on macOS)
2. Search for "Simple Coding Time Tracker"
3. Available settings:  
   - **Inactivity Timeout**: How long to wait before stopping the timer when no activity is detected but you are focused on VS Code (in minutes)
     - Default: 2.5 minutes
     - Lower values will stop tracking sooner when you're not actively coding
     - Higher values will continue tracking for longer during breaks
   - **Focus Timeout**: How long to continue tracking after VS Code loses focus (in minutes)
     - Default: 3 minutes
     - Determines how long to keep tracking when you switch to other applications
     - Useful for when you're referencing documentation or testing your application

     - **Modal Notifications**: Enable/disable modal behavior for health notifications (default: true)
     - **Enable Notifications**: Enable/disable all health notifications (default: true)
     - **Eye Rest Interval**: Frequency of eye rest reminders in minutes (default: 20) - Based on 20-20-20 rule
     - **Stretch Interval**: Frequency of stretch reminders in minutes (default: 30) - Recommended for posture health
     - **Break Threshold**: Coding duration before suggesting a break in minutes (default: 90) - Based on ultradian rhythms
